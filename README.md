# Digital_Voltmeter :voltmeter:

The aim of the work consisted of specifying, designing, describing an architecture, simulating, synthesising and implementing on an FPGA, using VHDL hardware descriptor language, a system for a digital voltmeter with a measurement range between 0V and 3.30V, with VGA output. 

A voltmeter consisting of a Sigma-Delta A/D converter with VGA output was implemented. This work was synthesised with the Vivado tool. 
The Arty A7-35 board was used.
